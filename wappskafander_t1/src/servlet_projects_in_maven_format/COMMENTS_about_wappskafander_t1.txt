========  wappskafander_t1 Specific Structure of this Folder  =============
===========================================================================

This folder is expected to contain servlet project folders.
The server starup scripts look for WAR files from 

<project folder name>
  |
  +--target
       |
       +--<WAR-file name>

One way to add/create a project folder is by executing this file 
with Bash.

txt1
)#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

S_INITIAL_WORKING_DIRECTORY="`pwd`"
S_PATH_TO_THIS_FOLDER="$( cd -P "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"
cd $S_PATH_TO_THIS_FOLDER # should the working directory differ

echo ""
if [ "$1" == "" ]; then
    read -p "Please enter folder name? " S_FOLDERNAME
    echo ""
else
    S_FOLDERNAME="$1"
fi

if [ -e ./$S_FOLDERNAME ]; then
    echo "A folder or file named \"$S_FOLDERNAME\" already exists. Skipping project creation. "
    echo ""
    exit # to avoid overwriting manually edited projects
fi


mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=$S_FOLDERNAME -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp -DinteractiveMode=false

# The WAR-files can be compiled, built, by executing:

cd $S_FOLDERNAME
mvn package

cd $S_INITIAL_WORKING_DIRECTORY # just for correctness
